1. Function Size
   No function may exceed 30 lines of code (aim for 20–30).
2. Single Responsibility
   Every function must perform exactly one clear task—and do it well.
3. Variable Naming
   Use short names (e.g. i, tmp) for small, local-scope variables.
   Use descriptive, verbose names (e.g. user_registration_timeout) for wide or long-lived scope variables.
4. Self‑Documenting Code
   Write code that is clear enough not to need comments.
   Add comments only when necessary, such as for complex logic or intent that can’t be made obvious through naming.
5. All code must be formatted by a tool like Prettier before being committed.
6. Code must pass linter checks (e.g., ESLint, Ruff) without any errors before being committed
7. No need to create unncecessary markdown files unlesss asked.
